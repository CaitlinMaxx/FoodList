#Food List

This app is a MERN search engine that allows the user to search through a database of "Safe Foods". There are two search options, search by food name and search by meal type. It makes use of Bootstrap.

##User Story

I made this app as someone with an eating disorder, which make eating a source of anxiety. The worse my mental state, the harder it is to deal with that anxiety. One of the things that helps is having a physical list of the foods that are my "safe foods". This app allow me to search through said list for what I need.

##Future Development

There are a bunch of things that I intend to do to better and expand this app:

- Add functionality to allow users to add and edit foods.
- Make the app usable by people other people with eating disorders. Be able to have an account to log into, have a profile with their own food lists.
- Functionality to add recipies to foods.
- create tracking abilities. This would allow users to track the foods they're eating and fulfil nutritional requirements by tracking how much of each food group the user has had that day.
- Add more search options such as by food group, ingredients and if the meal is cooked or not.
